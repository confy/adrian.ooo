Lately I have been looking for an oppurtunity to expand the languages in my toolbox and Go has become very interesting to me. This CRUD API was a good oppurtunity for me to get familiar with the language, and it is really suited for this project. I was struck by how easy it was to create a simple service like this, so I decided to document the process.

The github repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/confy/go_crud).

## Stack

I will be using the following Go modules:

#### Echo

Echo is a high performance, extensible, minimalist web framework for Go. It is designed to quickly create APIs with minimal effort. It is also very easy to use and has a lot of features.

#### GORM

GORM is an ORM or Object relational mapper for Go that aims to be developer friendly. It is a very powerful tool that makes it easy to interact with databases and supports MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server and Oracle.

#### SQLite with the GORM driver

SQLite is a lightweight file based database that is easy to use and does not require a server to run. It's not as fast as a database server, but it will allow us to quickly containerize our application.

We will also be using the SQLite driver for GORM. This driver allows us to use SQLite with GORM.

Eventually, the SQLite database will become a bottleneck as writes will lock the file momentarily. Later on in this project we'll experiment with benchmarking with Jmeter to see how our service performs under load.

## Setup

First make sure you have Go installed. You can download it [here](https://go.dev/dl/). I'm using Go 1.19

First we'll create a new directory for our project and initialize a new go module.

`mkdir go_crud`

`cd go_crud`

`go mod init go_crud`

This will create a new `go.mod` file in our project directory. This is used by Go to manage dependencies

```go
module go_crud

go 1.19
```

Next, we'll download our dependencies

`go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4 gorm.io/gorm gorm.io/driver/sqlite`

This will download the Echo framework, GORM and the SQLite driver for GORM. Our `go.mod` file should now look like this

```go
module go_crud

go 1.19

require (
	github.com/jinzhu/inflection v1.0.0 // indirect
	github.com/jinzhu/now v1.1.5 // indirect
	github.com/labstack/echo/v4 v4.9.1 // indirect

	golang.org/x/text v0.3.7 // indirect
	gorm.io/driver/sqlite v1.4.3 // indirect
	gorm.io/gorm v1.24.0 // indirect
)
```

## Making the server with Echo

Next we'll create a new file called `main.go` and add the following code.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
)

func main() {
	e := echo.New()
	e.Use(middleware.Logger())
	e.Use(middleware.Recover())

    e.GET("/hello", func(c echo.Context) error {
        return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello ðŸŒŽ")
    })

	e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}
```

This will create a new Echo server that listens on port 8080. We'll be using the Logger and Recover middleware to log requests and recover from panics. We'll also add a new route that returns a string when we visit `localhost:8080/hello`.

Now we can run our server with `go run main.go`
Visit `localhost:8080/hello` and you should see `Hello ðŸŒŽ` and see output in your terminal.

```

## Writing the model

We're going to make an API that allows us to create, read, update and delete from our SQLite database using JSON.

Let's start by making a model of our data using GORM. Create a new folder called `models` and add a new file called `model.go` with the following code.

```go
package models

import (
	"time"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

type Data struct {
	Value     uint `json:"value"`

	ID        uint   `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UpdatedAt time.Time
	DeletedAt gorm.DeletedAt
}
```

This is a simple model that has a single field called `Value` that is a uint. Following the Name and type of the field, we have a json tag that will be used to serialize the data to JSON. We also have the `ID`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt` and `DeletedAt` fields that are created automatically by GORM which I've chosen to define explicitly here.

## Creating a database factory

Next, we need to create a sqlite database, along with a table for our data. We'll do this in a new file called `database.go` in a new `database` folder.

```go
package database

import (
	"go_crud/models"

	"gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

var DB *gorm.DB

func Connect() *gorm.DB {
	db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to connect database")
	}
	db.AutoMigrate(&models.Data{})

	DB = db
	return DB
}
```

First we import our model, along with gorm and the sqlite driver. We'll also create a global variable called `DB` that we can use to access our database from other files.
The `Connect` function will create a new sqlite database called `test.db` and create a table for our data model(using `AutoMigrate`) before returning our DB. If the database already exists, it will just connect to it.

## Creating the routes

Ok let's tie everything together. We'll create a new file called `routes.go` in the `routes` folder and add the following code.

```go
package routes

import (
	"go_crud/database"
	"go_crud/models"
	"net/http"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

var DB = database.Connect()

func message(message string) map[string]string {
	return map[string]string{"message": message}
}

func parseUint(s string) (uint, error) {
  i, err := strconv.ParseUint(s, 10, 64)
  if err != nil {
	return 0, err
  }
  return uint(i), nil
}

```

We'll import our database, model and echo, along with http for status codes and strconv for formatting responses. Next we'll create our `DB` variable using the `Connect` function we created earlier.

We'll also create a message function for easily sending JSON responses. One thing that is worth noticing here is the way Go allows you to anonymously declare maps with specific types in the `map[string]string` syntax.

Finally we'll create our own wrapper function for parseUint that does some error handling. It's nice to have this up here so our routes don't get too cluttered. We'll use this to parse the `id` parameter from our routes. The first thing I kept noticing when I started using go was the way it forces you to handle errors. I think it's a good thing, but it can be a bit annoying at first. Many of the standard and library functions we are using are returning this `error` type, and I'm returning it in our own function as well.



As it is now we aren't using many of our imports, so Go will complain. We can fix this by adding some routes. Each route will receive `c echo.Context` and return the same `error` type

#### Create(POST)

```go
func PostData(c echo.Context) error {
	var data models.Data
	err := c.Bind(&data)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	DB.Create(&data)
	return c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, data)
}
```

#### Read(GET)

```go
func GetData(c echo.Context) error {
	id := c.Param("id")
	var data models.Data
	DB.First(&data, id)
	if data.ID == 0 {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusNotFound, message("Data not found"))
	}
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, data)
}
```

#### Update(PUT)

```go
func PutData(c echo.Context) error {
	id := c.Param("id")
	id_uint, err := strconv.ParseUint(id, 10, 64)
	if err != nil {
		return c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, message("Invalid ID"))
	}
	var data models.Data
	data.ID = uint(id_uint)
	DB.First(&data, id)
	if err := c.Bind(&data); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	DB.Save(&data)
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, data)
}
```

#### Delete(DELETE)

```go
func DeleteData(c echo.Context) error {
	//with error handling
	id := c.Param("id")
	var data models.Data
	DB.First(&data, id)
	if data.ID == 0 {
		return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusNotFound, message("Data not found"))
	}
	DB.Delete(&data)
	return c.NoContent(http.StatusNoContent)
}
```

#### Average

```go
func GetAverage(c echo.Context) error {
	items := []models.Data{}
	DB.Find(&items)
	var sum uint
	for _, item := range items {
		sum += item.Value
	}
	length := uint(len(items))
	res := struct {
		Average float64 `json:"average"`
		Length uint `json:"length"`
	} {
		Average: float64(sum) / float64(length),
		Length: length,
	}
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, res)
}
```

## Adding the routes to our server

Now that we have our routes, we need to add them to our server. Open up `main.go` and replace with the following code.

```go
package main

import (
	"go_crud/routes"

	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
)

func main() {
	e := echo.New()
	e.Use(middleware.Logger())
	e.Use(middleware.Recover())

	e.POST("/data", routes.PostData)
	e.GET("/data/:id", routes.GetData)
	e.PUT("/data/:id", routes.PutData)
	e.DELETE("/data/:id", routes.DeleteData)

	e.GET("/average", routes.GetAverage)

	e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}
```

We'll import our routes and also bind each of our routes to the `/data` or `/average` url. for our average function.

Finally, we can start our server using `go run main.go` and test our routes using curl or Postman.

If we post to `localhost:8080/data` with a JSON body of `{"value": 10}` we should get a response of

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "value": 10,
  "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "deleted_at": null
}
```

We'll post again using `{"value": 21}` and now we can query `localhost:8080/average` to get a response of

```json
{ "average": 15.5, "length": 2 }
```

## Conclusion
I hope this showcased how easy it is to get started with Go and how it can be used to create a simple web service. I also hope that this will encourage you to try out Go and see how it can be used to create your own projects. 
I would usually use python for something like this, and after dealing with some slowness in the past, Go really is the best of both worlds. It has the speed and simplicity of a compiled language and the ease of use of a scripting language.
